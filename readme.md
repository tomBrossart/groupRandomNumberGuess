## Overview 
This was an early group project to practice delegating tasks, understanding a problem/solution in a group, and working under a short timeline. 

## IDEAS FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS -- HARD/PRO mode
- be able to maintain current game functionality (persisting data)
- how to reset the game more efficiently  
- give inputs a class to reset them as a group 


Team Random Number Guess
=

In this challenge, you will need to create a new Node project (much like we did in lecture).

Base Mode:
=

The final version of this project will have two modes:

- setup mode
- play mode

### Tech: Node, Express, and JQuery

Setup Mode
-

Inputs on the web page:

- Maximum Number selector (at least 3 options)
- Start Game button

## Play Mode

- input for a guess for each of the four Players
- submit guesses button
- total guesses made indicator
- maximum number indicator
- details area for the last guess of each player (low/high)
- abandon game button that goes back to setup mode
- if a guess is correct PROMINENTLY Display which player won (make 'em FEEL it)
- restart button that leads to Setup Mode

Necessary Ingredients
-

AKA Client Demands...

All random number stuff should happen on the server: Generation of the random number upon game start as well as comparisons between guesses and the random correct answer. Have the random number generator be in its own node module, look back at the Module Madness activity to do this.

Take a moment to discuss with your team members why this is something that a client may demand.

Once you get it working, style it up, yo!

Hard Mode:
-

See how many of these you can implement in the given time. Remember to test when applying a feature and make sure your

- disallow two users two submit the same guess at the same time
- disallow any guess to be entered more than once
- disallow guesses less than 0 and higher than max
- hot/cold indicators (how can these be styled?, can the hot/cold range be adjusted for the size of the maximum number?)
- allow the choice of number of users
- allow users to create profiles that can include their name and also how many matches they have played/won (win percentage)
- add a bot player that guesses a random number each time in addition to the players (this bot should really talk trash when it beats a bunch of humans)
- what are your ideas? Have some fun with it
